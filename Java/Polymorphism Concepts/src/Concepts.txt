Polymorphism - (many forms). Greek word - root
An entity with multiple behaviors.
The ability of an entity to exhibit multiple behaviors.

Two kinds of polymorphism in Java:
a)Compile time Polymorphism, also static binding / early binding
	This can be achieved by overloading concepts (method overloading,constructor overloading)
b) Runtime Polymorphism / Dynamic Binding / late binding
	This can be achieved by method overriding concepts.
	
Overloading - (i)Method overloading,(ii)Constructor overloading, (iii)operator overloading	
(i) Method overloading - When a class contains two methods with the same name, but with different number of arguements, then these two methods are called overloaded methods.

Example 1 - 

Class X {
	void m1(int a){
	
	}
	void m1(int a, int b){
	
	}
}

Example 2 - 

Class Y {
	void m1(int a){
	
	}
	void m1(char a){
	
	}
}
